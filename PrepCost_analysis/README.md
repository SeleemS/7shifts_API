**Prep Cost Analysis Script**

**Overview**

This script is a great resource for cost managers and chefs, aiding them in a detailed analysis of kitchen prep costs broken down by individual items on a weekly basis. By providing a week-by-week comparison, it enables a clear understanding of the fluctuating costs, allowing for more informed decision-making regarding menu pricing, inventory management, and other operational aspects. Moreover, the automation of data retrieval and analysis streamlines the managerial workflow, thus saving valuable time that can be invested in enhancing the dining experience.

**Script Workflow:**

1. Data Retrieval: Initially, the script automatically fetches data from the 7shifts API, which contains comprehensive information about the roles, hours worked, and pay for each kitchen item.
2. Data Transformation: The retrieved data, which is in a nested JSON format, is transformed into a more manageable structure, facilitating easier analysis.
3. Data Aggregation: It then aggregates the data based on roles and calculates the total hours worked and the total pay for each role in the specified week.
4. Data Comparison: The script compares the data week by week, allowing for a detailed analysis of variations in prep costs for each item.
5. Data Visualization: Subsequently, the script visualizes the data through bar charts, presenting a clear graphical representation of the total hours and total pay for each role, week by week, and saving these charts as PNG files for easy reference and sharing.
